Assemblies – CAD Project

# 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete 3D CAD assembly of a hydraulic cylinder piping system, designed and assembled using Siemens NX.

The project focuses on realistic industrial modeling practices, proper component hierarchy, and accurate assembly constraints suitable for manufacturing-oriented applications.

The assembly demonstrates fluid entry and exit piping integration with a hydraulic cylinder, commonly used in industrial machinery, automation systems, and heavy equipment.

🛠️ Tools & Software Used

1. CAD Software: Siemens NX
2. Modeling Approach: Parametric solid modeling
3. Assembly Type: Top-down & bottom-up hybrid
4. File Format: .prt (Siemens NX Part Files)

🧩 File Description

1. ASSEMBLY MAIN.prt

   Master assembly file integrating all sub-assemblies and components.

3. Final assembly.prt / assemblyfinal assembly.prt

   Consolidated assemblies showing the complete system alignment and fit.

5. Assembly cylinder pipe assembly tube entry.prt

   Entry-side piping assembly connected to the hydraulic cylinder inlet.

7. Assemblycylinder piping tube exit assembly.prt

   Exit-side piping assembly for fluid discharge from the cylinder.
