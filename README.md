### CAD Assembly Project (Siemens NX)

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project contains a complete 3D CAD assembly of a hydraulic cylinder piping system assembled using **Siemens NX**.

The focus of the project is on realistic industrial assembly practices, proper component hierarchy, and accurate constraint management suitable for manufacturing-oriented workflows.

> **Note:** All components were pre-existing parts. This project demonstrates **assembly integration, alignment, and constraint management**, not part modeling.

The assembly represents fluid entry and exit piping integration with a hydraulic cylinder, commonly used in industrial machinery, automation systems, and heavy equipment.
